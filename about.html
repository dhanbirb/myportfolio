            My dog Leo is the world's best dog
          </p>
          <p>
            I am an only child but he is extremely sassy and naughty towards me and steals all of my things so he is basically my brother and I don't feel like an only child at all because I have my sweet little doggie
          </p>
          <p>
            But my doggo is not smol at all. He is the size of a pony. He is a massive standard poodle. poodle noodle. He is multiple shades of gray and white with flecks of brown and gold here and there. He used to have some black fur too but as he got older the black fur faded. But the funny thing is he is not old at all. In fact he is only 3.

          <h3>Writing</h3>
          <p>
            A fun fact about me is that I am a writer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am the author of 2 novels. One is called Priya's Journey (I renamed it to Priya's Journey from its previous title of The Monastery which was not a very exciting title because people sadly judge books by their covers) and the other book, which I co-wrote with my best friend, is called Our Worlds Apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I don't have writer's block and I actually have writer's juice, I love writing and I find it really fun. Sadly I am under a long period of writer's block and I continue to look for inspiration.

          <h3>Fun stuff</h3>
          <p>
           I like creating random words. One of my favorite pastimes is assigning random words to my dog. My dog's name is Leo, but I call him random things like litmus (like litmus paper from chemistry) but pronounced leetmos. (emphasis on the T). I also call him a wingus, a chodageen, a breab and more. These are completely gibberish words. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I love looking at funny youtube shorts, especially the ones about TV series. My preferred choice of music is K-pop.
